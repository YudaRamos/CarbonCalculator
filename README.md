###Spring Boot System Requirements

*In Spring Boot everything is done with Java, so the Java Runtime Environment (Java platform) is the main software component for the framework to work.
*Since this application is not only run but also used for development with Java, at least version 8 (in this case version 11 was used) of the so-called Java Development Kit (JDK) is required.
*It also requires that we have the current version of the Spring framework installed on the system.
*As a dependency manager we can use Maven (as of 3.3) or Gradle (as of 4.4). In this case Maven was chosen.

Eclipse was used as an integrated development environment, open source and multiplatform, whose main use is to serve as a programming, compilation and debugging platform for a host of programming languages. Although its most widespread function is to be used to program in Java, its modularity allows its set of tools to be extended to serve as a base for programming in C or Python, among many others.

###Hardware resources
*Processor: any current Intel or AMD microprocessor, although for this case an Intel CORE i5 7th Gen was used.
*Memory: About 8GB could be enough, in this case we have 16 GB of RAM.
