### General Info
***
CarbonCalculator is a web application capable of calculating the carbon footprint generated by different daily activities. It is created with the idea of ​​making the world aware of climate change, providing real data on the carbon footprint generated by users.
CarbonCalculator uses the services of different external API's, in order to provide an exact calculation of the footprint generated by the user.
It offers information about the footprint generated and provides different tips to help reduce the impact of it.

## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:

* [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
## Installation
***
A little intro about the installation. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YudaRamos/CarbonCalculator.git
$ cd  CarbonCalculator/carbonCalculatorapp
$ npm install
$ Then to execute the program from Visual Studio Code, the following command must be used:
$ ng serve --ssl true --ssl-key localhost.key --ssl-cert localhost.crt
```

And so you can access the application by entering the following url in the browser of your choice (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox...etc.): 
* https://localhost:4200.
The application has implemented the social login through Facebook and the test user is shown below:
* Username: **dctocycfql_1653651542@tfbnw.net**
* Password: **Password1234@**

##### Spring Boot System Requirements:

* In Spring Boot everything is done with Java, so the Java Runtime Environment (Java platform) is the main software component for the framework to work.
* Since this application is not only run but also used for development with Java, at least version 8 (in this case version 11 was used) of the so-called Java Development Kit (JDK) is required.
* It also requires that we have the current version of the Spring framework installed on the system.
* As a dependency manager we can use Maven (as of 3.3) or Gradle (as of 4.4). In this case Maven was chosen.

Eclipse was used as an integrated development environment, open source and multiplatform, whose main use is to serve as a programming, compilation and debugging platform for a host of programming languages. Although its most widespread function is to be used to program in Java, its modularity allows its set of tools to be extended to serve as a base for programming in C or Python, among many others.

#####  Hardware resources
* Processor: any current Intel or AMD microprocessor, although for this case an Intel CORE i5 7th Gen was used.
* Memory: About 8GB could be enough, in this case we have 16 GB of RAM.
